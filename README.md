# 🧪 ROOTED Ventures Lab — External & Experimental Products

This repository documents **non-ROOTED ventures and experiments**.

These ideas are:
- NOT part of the ROOTED OS
- NOT governed by ROOTED law
- NOT bound to Kids Mode rules unless explicitly stated
- NOT production commitments

They are exploratory only.

---

## 🚧 Purpose

This repo exists to:
- Capture ideas without polluting ROOTED governance
- Prevent roadmap confusion
- Protect ROOTED from scope creep
- Give space for experimentation

---

## 🧠 Venture Categories

### 2️⃣ Ethical / Kids-Safe AI Systems (Future Research)
Exploration of:

### 3️⃣ Gaming Platform (Concept Only)
A potential future platform inspired by ROOTED governance:
